# user@reltale:~$ cat hacking.md

I have been into computers as long as I can remember. After watching some documentaries on hacking I decided I would like to join the space. I now read various amounts of documentation on the subject and I hope I can become far more technical in the future. If I make any write ups for any project I am working on or any CTF I am completing or have completed it will reside here.
