I started making music many years ago, around the beginning of middle school. As of recently I decided I want to make EDM. With me listening to many artists like Skrillex, Daft Punk, and Virtual Riot already, I had been very familiar with the scene and thought I should dip my toes in it. But the form of music I was working on wasn't expressive enough for me, and I felt as it was too mainstream. Finding more and more EDM subgenres I had stumbled upon a group of subgenres that I now love so deeply. These being Breakcore and Lolicore. After finding artists Goreshit, Sewerslvt, and Loli in early 20s, I had concluded this is what I want to persue. I am now learning music production and hopefully I can make music that I am fully competent with. I have been working in Bandlab but it is way too restrictive so I am now in the process of switching to Ableton so I can finally let my imagination run wild. I also plan on buying some modular synths and MIDI devices other than the Launchpad I currently have to make some interesting sounds. But I'm getting ahead of myself here I am far ways out from that point. I post music on SoundCloud (although I have the habit of privating the songs soon after) and I plan on being available on all platforms.
