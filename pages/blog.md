**11/13/22 -** I made a blog page so I can talk about what's on my mind and reflect on it later. Christmas is coming soon, going to buy a new microphone and some books on pentesting. I could torrent the books if I really wanted but I want the physical copies. Might even ask for some books on philosophy as I have been planning on getting some physical copies on that aswell. Funny to think that when I was younger I absolutely hated books and now I love them enough to ask for them on Christmas. I also need to work on my computer server. I have been kind of neglecting it for a while because I am quite lazy, but it is not being used at all. I would turn it into NAS but I dont have a wired connection for it, so it isnt going be very fast or reliable. Might just use it as a media server, but my family pays for streaming services so I don't think it will be used often. Sorry for everything being so jumbled I'm not good at writing.
